1. Here are the 72 weak defenses and the undefended model (model\-mnist\-cnn\-clean.h5) in the vanilla version of Athena (referred to as Vanilla Athena).

2. The undefended model is the targeted model in the context of zero-knowledge threat model.

3. Each weak defense is a supervised image classifier that is associated with one transformation. A weak defense is named in the pattern of "model\-\<dataset\>\-\<model\_type\>\-\<transformation\>.h5", where dataset is "mnist" and model\_type is "cnn" in this project.
